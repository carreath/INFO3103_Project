# MemeMachine
## This project was made as a final project for INFO3103
### 3103 was centered around RESTful services
### MemeMachine is a Flask python REST web service with a simple angularJS frontend and was used as the final project for the class.

MemeMachine
	- A simple image posting/sharing webservice

	TO RUN:
		Open a terminal window in MemeMachine/app
		Ensure your local python has flask installed
    
		run './MemeApp.py'

    You may view other submissions without logging in but
    you do require a my.unb login to access your account

  
    Testing can be done by running the sh file in a separate terminal window

		All tests were designed to show the functionality 
		of MemeMachine as of now.
